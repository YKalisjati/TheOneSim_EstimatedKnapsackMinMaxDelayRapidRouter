The_One_KJT is my undergraduate thesis research using Java, where I attempt to implement the Knapsack Algorithm, Link Duration Estimation Algorithm on Rapid Routing into the case of message delivery in vehicles to demonstrate the effectiveness of bandwidth transfer application for forwarding using the link duration estimation method in determining the knapsack capacity value based on the average message delivery percentage and delay.
